# Go Coffee Service ☕

A lightweight backend service simulation for a coffee shop, built with **Go (Golang)**. This is a learning project focused on mastering the core concepts of Go development.

##  Overview
This service demonstrates how to handle orders, apply discounts using pointer receivers, and prepare data for frontend consumption using JSON serialization.

##  Features
- **Data Modeling:** Custom `Order` struct with JSON tags for seamless integration.
- **Pointers in Action:** Efficient state management using pointer receivers (modifying order status and price).
- **Clean Code:** Separation of concerns between models and main logic.
- **JSON Marshaling:** Formatted JSON output for order receipts.

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Go 1.2x+
- **Standard Library:** `encoding/json`, `fmt`, `log`
